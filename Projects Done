1.Plant 3D → MongoDB:

I access the active Plant 3D document and project

I fetch Plant 3D objects (pipes, equipment, inline assets)

I extract properties using PnP DataObjects

I serialize data and store it in MongoDB


Workflow:
Explain this flow slowly:

CommandMethod starts

Get active document

Get Plant project

Iterate entities

Read PnP data

Save to MongoDB

--------------------------------------------------------
2.Created custom components in Plant 3D using Python scripts (Cable Tray):

I created a custom parametric component using Plant 3D Python scripting

The component was a Cable Tray with configurable dimensions

I defined parameters like length, width, height, thickness

I generated geometry using Plant 3D primitive functions

I registered the script so it appears in Spec Editor and model palette.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Text Manager-Revit:

User clicks Text Manager button in Revit

Plugin reads text notes and text types using Revit API

Plugin filters data based on text size, type, or view

Plugin performs the selected action (highlight, replace, view, purge)

Changes are committed using a Transaction.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Level and Grid Size:

User clicks the Levels & Grids Manager button

Plugin collects Levels and Grids using Revit API

Plugin reads their annotation properties (text size & symbol size)

User selects new circle size and text size

Plugin updates elements inside a Transaction
